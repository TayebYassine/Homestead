# DATABASE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

database:
  # Database Provider Selection
  # Choose where to store all region data, claims, and player information
  #
  # Available providers:
  #
  # - sqlite (Default, recommended for most servers)
  #   Good for: Small to medium servers (< 100 daily players)
  #   Pros: No setup required, automatic, simple
  #   Cons: Less performant with many players, single file
  #
  # - mysql
  #   Good for: Large servers (100+ daily players)
  #   Pros: Excellent performance, can run on separate machine, scalable
  #   Cons: Requires MySQL server setup and configuration
  #
  # - mariadb
  #   Good for: Large servers (100+ daily players)
  #   Pros: MySQL alternative, same performance benefits
  #   Cons: Requires MariaDB server setup
  #
  # - postgresql
  #   Good for: Large servers (100+ daily players)
  #   Pros: Advanced features, excellent reliability
  #   Cons: Requires PostgreSQL server setup
  #
  # - yaml
  #   Good for: Very small/friend servers (< 20 players)
  #   Pros: Human-readable files, easy to edit manually
  #   Cons: Slowest option, not recommended for production
  provider: "sqlite"

  # PostgreSQL Connection Settings
  # Only used if provider is set to "postgresql"
  # Note: Default PostgreSQL port is 5432, not 3306
  postgresql:
    host: "localhost"           # Database server address (IP or domain)
    port: 3306                  # PostgreSQL port (default: 5432)
    username: "USERNAME"        # Database user with full permissions
    password: "PASSWORD"        # Database password (keep secure!)
    database: "homestead_data"  # Database name (create this first)
    table_prefix: ""            # Optional prefix for table names (e.g., "hs_")

  # MariaDB Connection Settings
  # Only used if provider is set to "mariadb"
  # MariaDB is a MySQL fork with similar configuration
  mariadb:
    host: "localhost"           # Database server address
    port: 3306                  # MariaDB port (default: 3306)
    username: "USERNAME"        # Database user
    password: "PASSWORD"        # Database password
    database: "homestead_data"  # Database name
    table_prefix: ""            # Table name prefix (optional)

  # MySQL Connection Settings
  # Only used if provider is set to "mysql"
  # Most popular choice for Minecraft servers
  mysql:
    host: "localhost"           # Database server address
    port: 3306                  # MySQL port (default: 3306)
    username: "USERNAME"        # Database user
    password: "PASSWORD"        # Database password
    database: "homestead_data"  # Database name
    table_prefix: ""            # Table name prefix (optional)

  # SQLite Configuration
  # Only used if provider is set to "sqlite"
  # File will be created automatically in plugins/Homestead/ folder
  # No additional setup required - works out of the box
  sqlite: "homestead_data.db"

# Cache Flush Interval
# How often (in seconds) cached data is written to the database
#
# What is caching?
# Homestead keeps recent region data in memory for fast access, then periodically
# saves changes to disk. This improves performance significantly.
#
# Recommendations by server size:
# - Small servers (< 20 players): 30 seconds (default)
# - Medium servers (20-50 players): 60 seconds
# - Large servers (50-100 players): 120-180 seconds
# - Very large servers (100+ players with SQLite): 300 seconds (5 minutes)
#
# Lower values = More frequent saves, slightly more CPU usage
# Higher values = Less frequent saves, better performance, slight data loss risk on crash
#
# Note: Data is ALWAYS saved when:
# - Server stops gracefully
# - Player logs out
# - Region is deleted
# - /hsadmin reload is used
cache-interval: 30

# ============================================================================
# REGION SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Startup Data Cleanup
# Automatically fix corrupted data when server starts
#
# Removes/fixes:
# - Regions in worlds that no longer exist
# - Invalid player UUIDs
# - Broken chunk coordinates
# - Orphaned sub-areas
# - Corrupted war data
#
# Recommended: Keep enabled unless it causes startup issues
# Disable if: Your server has many worlds that load later, or uses dynamic world loading
#
# Values: true = Clean on startup, false = Skip cleanup
clean-startup: true

# Log Private Region Chat to Console
# Save all region chat messages to server console/logs
#
# Region chat is the private communication channel between region members
# Enable this to:
# - Moderate player messages for rule violations
# - Investigate reports of harassment
# - Detect ban evasion discussions
# - Monitor suspicious activity
# - Keep records for appeals
#
# Privacy note: Players should be informed their region chat may be logged
#
# Values: true = Log all region chat, false = Private (not logged)
log-private-chat: true

# Adjacent Chunks Requirement
# Force all claimed chunks in a region to be touching each other
#
# When enabled (true):
# - Players can only claim chunks next to existing chunks (connected)
# - Creates compact, organized regions
# - Prevents scattered claims
# - Easier to visualize on maps
#
# When disabled (false):
# - Players can claim chunks anywhere, even far apart
# - Useful for multi-location builds (overworld base + nether farm)
# - More flexibility but messier world
#
# Recommendation: Enable (true) for cleaner, organized server
# Disable (false) if you want maximum player freedom
adjacent-chunks: true

# Chunk Purchase Price
# How much money players must pay to claim each chunk
#
# Set to 0.0 for free claiming (no economy required)
# Set higher to create an economic sink and limit excessive claiming
#
# Examples:
# - 0.0 = Free claiming (good for small servers)
# - 100.0 = $100 per chunk (moderate cost)
# - 1000.0 = $1000 per chunk (expensive, limits sprawl)
#
# Note: Requires economy plugin (Vault + EssentialsX or similar)
# Note: This is SEPARATE from upkeep (which is recurring)
chunk-price: 0.0

# Auto-Select Target Region
# Automatically set the region a player is standing in as their active region
#
# When enabled (true):
# - Standing in your region automatically targets it for commands
# - No need to use /region set target [region] every time
# - More convenient for players
# - Commands like /claim, /unclaim work immediately
#
# When disabled (false):
# - Players must manually target regions with /region set target
# - More control but less convenient
# - Useful if players frequently work with multiple regions
#
# Recommendation: Keep enabled (true) for ease of use
autoset-target-region: true

# Disabled Worlds (Exact Names)
# List of worlds where players CANNOT claim chunks
#
# World names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
# Use this for:
# - Resource worlds that reset
# - PvP arenas
# - Minigame worlds
# - Event areas
# - Any world where claims shouldn't persist
#
# Example world names:
# - "world_the_end" (default end world)
# - "world_nether" (if you don't want nether claims)
# - "pvp_arena" (custom PvP world)
# - "resource_world" (mining world that resets)
#
# Find world names: Look in your server folder - each folder is a world
# Or use /worlds if you have a world management plugin
disabled-worlds-exact:
  - "world_the_end"
  - "factions"
  - "pvp_arena"

# Disabled Worlds (Pattern Matching)
# Disable claiming in worlds matching these patterns
#
# Uses wildcards (*) for flexible matching:
# - "em_*" matches any world starting with "em_" (EliteMobs dungeons)
# - "*_temp" matches any world ending with "_temp"
# - "minigame_*_end" matches "minigame_skywars_end", "minigame_bedwars_end", etc.
#
# Perfect for:
# - Temporary/dynamic worlds (EliteMobs, MythicDungeons)
# - Auto-generated minigame worlds
# - Test/development worlds
# - Any worlds with consistent naming patterns
#
# Examples:
# EliteMobs creates worlds like: em_dungeon1, em_dungeon2, em_lair
# Pattern "em_*" disables all of them without listing each one
disabled-worlds-pattern:
  - "em_*"
  - "minigame_*_end"

# Disabled Flags
# Prevent players from changing these specific flags
#
# Listed flags:
# - Won't appear in the flags menu
# - Can't be changed with /region flags commands
# - Always use the default value from this config
# - Can still be changed by operators directly in database (not recommended)
#
# Use this to:
# - Enforce server-wide rules (e.g., no PvP anywhere)
# - Prevent exploit-enabling flag combinations
# - Lock down dangerous settings
# - Maintain consistent gameplay
#
# Examples of flags to disable:
# - "pvp" (if you want PvP off everywhere)
# - "wither-damage" (prevent wither griefing)
# - "explosions-damage" (prevent TNT/creeper damage)
disabled-flags:
  - "use-bells"
  - "take-fall-damage"

# Region Borders Visualization
# Show region boundaries using particles or blocks
borders:
  # Enable border display for players
  # When enabled, players can toggle borders with /region borders
  # Helpful for:
  # - Seeing exactly where your region ends
  # - Planning expansions
  # - Avoiding claiming into others' regions
  # - Visualizing sub-areas
  enabled: true

  # Border Display Type
  # How borders are shown to players
  #
  # particles: Floating particle effects along chunk edges
  #   Pros: Non-intrusive, doesn't block building, clear visibility
  #   Cons: Some resource packs disable particles
  #
  # blocks: Client-side blocks appear at chunk edges
  #   Pros: Very visible, works even if particles are disabled
  #   Cons: Can interfere with building view, may look cluttered
  #
  # Recommendation: Use "particles" for most servers
  type: particles

  # Block Type for Borders (only used if type is "blocks")
  # What block appears when using block-based borders
  # Can be any Minecraft block type (GLASS, GLOWSTONE, BARRIER, etc.)
  # GRAY_GLAZED_TERRACOTTA is nice because it's distinctive
  block-type: GRAY_GLAZED_TERRACOTTA

# Enter/Exit Region Messages
# Display messages when players enter or leave regions
enter-exit-region-message:
  # Enable enter/exit messages
  # Shows region name and description when crossing boundaries
  enabled: true

  # Message Display Type
  # Where the message appears on screen
  #
  # title: Large text in center of screen (most visible)
  # actionbar: Small text above hotbar (less intrusive)
  # chat: Regular chat message (least intrusive)
  type: 'title'

  # Message Content for Each Display Type
  # Customize what players see when entering/exiting
  #
  # Available variables:
  # {region-displayname} - The region's name
  # {region-description} - The region's description
  # {region-owner} - Who owns the region
  #
  # Color codes: Use & for colors (&2 = green, &7 = gray, etc.)
  messages:
    # Messages shown when entering a region
    enter:
      title: [ "&2{region-displayname}", "&7{region-description}" ]
      actionbar: "&7You enter the territory of &2{region-displayname}&7: {region-description}"
      chat: "&7You enter the territory of &2{region-displayname}&7: {region-description}"

    # Messages shown when leaving a region
    exit:
      title: [ "&3Wilderness", "&7Roam the wild!" ]
      actionbar: "&7You left the territory of &2{region-displayname}&7."
      chat: "&7You left the territory of &2{region-displayname}&7."

# Sub-Area Selection Tool
# Configure the tool used to create sub-areas within regions
selection-tool:
  # Item used for selecting sub-area corners
  # Default: GOLDEN_HOE (easy to craft, distinctive)
  #
  # Can be changed to any Minecraft item:
  # - WOODEN_AXE (WorldEdit-style)
  # - STICK (simple and cheap)
  # - BLAZE_ROD (more distinctive)
  # - Any other item type
  #
  # Players craft/obtain this item, then:
  # - Left-click a block = First corner
  # - Right-click a block = Second corner
  # - Run /region subareas create [name]
  item: GOLDEN_HOE

  # Title Messages During Selection
  # Shown to players as they select corners
  # Provides feedback on selection progress
  #
  # Color codes supported (&7 = gray, &a = green, &c = red, &e = yellow)
  messages:
    none: "&7Please select two corners inside your region."
    firstCorner: "&7First corner: &a✔ &7| Second corner: &c✘"
    secondCorner: "&7First corner: &c✘ &7| Second corner: &a✔"
    selectionDone: "&7Use &e/rg subareas create [name] &7to finish."

# ECONOMY FEATURES
# ============================================================================
# All economy features require:
# - Vault plugin installed
# - Economy plugin installed (EssentialsX recommended)
# ============================================================================

# Region Upkeep System
# Require region owners to pay recurring maintenance fees based on claimed chunks
#
# How it works:
# 1. Owner claims chunks
# 2. After grace period, upkeep becomes due
# 3. Payment auto-deducted from region bank
# 4. If you can't pay, chunks are unclaimed (if enabled)
# 5. Timer resets for next payment
#
# Purpose:
# - Prevents land hoarding (players only claim what they use)
# - Creates money sink for economy
# - Encourages active players over inactive
# - Keeps world from being completely claimed
upkeep:
  # Enable upkeep system
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: false

  # Cost Per Chunk (per upkeep period)
  # How much each claimed chunk costs to maintain
  #
  # Formula: Total Upkeep = Chunks Claimed × Per-Chunk Cost
  #
  # Examples:
  # - 10 chunks × $100 = $1,000 upkeep
  # - 20 chunks × $100 = $2,000 upkeep
  #
  # Balancing suggestions:
  # - Small casual server: $10-50 per chunk
  # - Medium server: $100-200 per chunk
  # - Large competitive server: $500-1000 per chunk
  per-chunk: 100.0

  # Automatically Unclaim Unpaid Chunks
  # What happens if a player can't afford upkeep
  #
  # When true:
  # - Chunks are automatically unclaimed if payment fails
  # - Usually last-claimed chunks are removed first
  # - Player keeps chunks they can afford
  #
  # When false:
  # - Chunks stay claimed even if payment fails
  # - Region goes into "debt" status
  # - May have grace period before forced unclaim
  #
  # Recommendation: true for automatic cleanup
  unclaim-chunks: true

  # Grace Period for New Regions (in seconds)
  # How long before the FIRST upkeep payment is due
  # Gives new players time to establish themselves and earn money
  #
  # Common values:
  # - 604800 = 1 week (recommended)
  # - 1209600 = 2 weeks (generous)
  # - 2592000 = ~30 days (very generous)
  # - 259200 = 3 days (competitive servers)
  #
  # Set higher for casual servers, lower for competitive ones
  start-upkeep: 604800

  # Upkeep Payment Frequency (in seconds)
  # How often upkeep payments are required
  #
  # Common values:
  # - 604800 = 1 week (recommended)
  # - 1209600 = 2 weeks
  # - 2592000 = ~30 days
  # - 86400 = 1 day (very frequent, for testing)
  #
  # Shorter intervals = More active economy, more player engagement
  # Longer intervals = Less micromanagement, more casual
  upkeep-timer: 604800

# Member Taxes System
# Require trusted members to pay fees to stay in a region
#
# How it works:
# 1. Owner sets tax amount with /region set tax [amount]
# 2. Members must pay on schedule
# 3. Payment auto-deducted from member's personal balance
# 4. Money goes to region bank
# 5. If member can't pay, they're auto-untrusted
#
# Purpose:
# - Help owners cover upkeep costs
# - Share region expenses among members
# - Generate income for region improvements
# - Automatic membership management
taxes:
  # Enable member tax system
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: false

  # Minimum Tax Amount
  # Lowest tax owners can set
  # Set to 0.0 to allow free membership
  min-tax: 0.0

  # Maximum Tax Amount
  # Highest tax owners can set
  # Prevents excessive fees
  # Example: $10,000 = very high but not unlimited
  max-tax: 10000.0

  # Tax Payment Frequency (in seconds)
  # How often members must pay
  #
  # Usually matches upkeep-timer so members can help pay upkeep
  # Common value: 604800 = 1 week
  tax-timer: 604800

# Region Renting System
# Allow owners to rent their regions to other players temporarily
#
# How it works:
# 1. Owner creates rental sign or uses /region set rent
# 2. Player clicks sign or uses command
# 3. Renter pays fee, gets access for duration
# 4. After time expires, access is removed
# 5. Owner can cancel early with /region rent cancel
#
# Perfect for:
# - Shop spaces in marketplaces
# - Event venues
# - Temporary housing
# - Seasonal builds
renting:
  # Enable region renting
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: true

  # Minimum Rental Price
  # Lowest amount owners can charge per rental period
  # Prevents underselling/exploits
  min-rent: 500.0

  # Maximum Rental Price
  # Highest amount owners can charge
  # Prevents inflation/excessive fees
  max-rent: 10000000.0

# Region Selling System
# Allow owners to sell their regions permanently to other players
#
# How it works:
# 1. Owner creates sale sign or uses /region set sell
# 2. Buyer clicks sign or uses command
# 3. Buyer pays, immediately becomes new owner
# 4. Original owner loses all access
# 5. Cannot be reversed (permanent)
#
# Perfect for:
# - Trading prime locations
# - Selling developed builds
# - Player-driven real estate market
# - Quitting players liquidating assets
selling:
  # Enable region selling
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: true

  # Minimum Sale Price
  # Lowest price owners can sell for
  # Prevents giving away valuable regions
  min-sell: 10.0

  # Maximum Sale Price
  # Highest price owners can sell for
  # Prevents economy inflation
  max-sell: 1000000000.0

# Sub-Areas Feature
# Allow creating smaller zones within regions with different permissions
#
# Use cases:
# - Shop inside private base (public access to shop only)
# - PvP arena in safe town
# - Public farm in protected region
# - Guest areas with limited permissions
sub-areas:
  # Enable sub-areas creation
  # Requires selection tool (configured above)
  enabled: true

# Wars System
# Enable region-vs-region PvP conflicts with economic stakes
#
# How it works:
# 1. Owner declares war on another region with prize money
# 2. Special combat rules activate
# 3. If declarer dies (any death), they lose and pay prize
# 4. If they kill enemy owner, they win and receive prize
# 5. Either side can surrender to end war early
#
# Changes during war:
# - PvP enabled in both regions
# - Doors/gates accessible to enemies
# - Passthrough allowed
# - High-risk, high-reward gameplay
#
# Perfect for:
# - Faction/nation conflicts
# - Territory disputes
# - Competitive gameplay
# - Economic warfare
wars:
  # Enable wars feature
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: false

  # Minimum War Prize
  # Smallest prize that can be wagered
  # Too low = pointless wars
  min-prize: 1000.0

  # Maximum War Prize
  # Largest prize that can be wagered
  # Prevents bankrupting players
  max-prize: 1000000000.0

# Welcome Signs Feature
# Allow players to create clickable signs that teleport to regions
#
# How it works:
# 1. Player places sign with format: [Welcome] / RegionName / /
# 2. Other players click sign
# 3. They teleport to region's home point
#
# Perfect for:
# - Spawn marketplace directories
# - Player base showcases
# - Easy navigation without commands
# - Non-technical player access
welcome-signs:
  # Enable welcome signs
  # Alternative to /region visit command
  enabled: false

# LIMITS & PERMISSIONS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Claim Limits System
# Control how many regions/chunks/members each player can have
limits:
  # Limit Assignment Method
  #
  # 'static': Everyone gets same limits (except operators)
  #   - Simple, no permissions plugin needed
  #   - Two tiers: non-op and op
  #   - Good for small/friend servers
  #
  # 'groups': Limits based on permission groups (LuckPerms, etc.)
  #   - Different limits per rank (default, vip, mvp, admin, etc.)
  #   - Rewards players for donating/ranking up
  #   - Requires permissions plugin
  #   - Good for servers with donation ranks
  method: 'static'

  # Group-Based Limits (only used if method = 'groups')
  # Define limits for each permission group
  #
  # For each group, configure:
  # - regions: Max regions player can create

# Reward System - Bonus chunks/members for member count
# Give region owners extra claims for building a community
rewards:
  # Enable rewards system
  # Requires economy plugin
  enabled: true

  # Reward per Trusted Member
  # For each member in the region, owner gets bonus chunks/sub-areas
  #
  # Example: If you have 3 members and for-each-member.chunks is 2:
  # - Base limit: 10 chunks
  # - Bonus: 3 members × 2 chunks = +6 chunks
  # - Total: 16 chunks available
  #
  # Set to 0 to disable that reward type
  for-each-member:
    chunks: 2     # Bonus chunks per member (0 = disabled)
    subareas: 1   # Bonus sub-areas per member (0 = disabled)

  # Reward by Playtime
  # Give bonuses based on total time played on the server
  #
  # How it works:
  # - Plugin tracks active playtime (AFK time doesn't count)
  # - When player reaches a tier, they get those rewards
  # - Only the HIGHEST tier applies (not cumulative)
  #
  # Example: Player has 10 hours playtime
  # - Qualifies for 30min tier (1 chunk)
  # - Qualifies for 3hr tier (2 chunks)
  # - Gets 2 chunks total (from highest tier)
  #
  # Time format:
  # - minutes: Number of minutes
  # - hours: Number of hours
  # - days: Number of days
  # All three add together: 1d + 2h + 30m = 1 day, 2 hours, 30 minutes
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Keep values ASCENDING (higher time = more rewards)

# Region Leveling System
# Reward players for killing mobs inside their region
#
# How it works:
# 1. Player kills mob in their region
# 2. Region gains XP based on mob type
# 3. At certain levels, region unlocks rewards
# 4. Rewards stack with other bonuses
#
# Perfect for:
# - Encouraging active gameplay
# - Rewarding grinders/farmers
# - Progressive gameplay mechanics
# - Extra goals beyond just building
levels:
  # Enable region leveling
  # XP is earned by killing mobs inside your region
  enabled: true

  # XP Gained by Killing Each Entity Type
  # Format: ENTITY_NAME: [ min_xp, max_xp ]
  # Actual XP given is random between min and max
  #
  # Balance considerations:
  # - Common mobs (zombie, skeleton): Lower XP (10-20)
  # - Uncommon mobs (piglin, enderman): Medium XP (50-100)
  # - Rare mobs (wither, ender dragon): High XP (500-3000)
  # - Passive mobs (pig, cow): Low XP (10-20)
  #
  # Prevents exploits by requiring kills IN your region
  on-kill-entity:
    ENDER_DRAGON: [ 1000, 3000 ]  # Hardest boss
    WARDEN: [ 500, 1000 ]         # Difficult mob

  # Level-Based Rewards
  # When region reaches a level, owner gets these bonuses
  #
  # Format for each level:
  # level_number:
  #   chunks: Bonus chunks
  #   members: Bonus member slots
  #   subareas: Bonus sub-areas
  #   upkeep-reduction: Percentage reduction (0-100)
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Keep levels in ASCENDING order
  # Higher levels should have better/equal rewards than lower levels
  #
  # Upkeep reduction stacks: Level 5 (5%) + Level 10 (5%) = 10% total at level 10
  rewards:
    # Level 5 rewards

# - Custom icons per region
# - Custom colors per region
# - Region information on click
# - Auto-updates when claims change
dynamic-maps:
  # Enable map integration
  # Automatically detects which map plugin you have
  enabled: true

  # Update Frequency (in seconds)
  # How often the map refreshes to show new/changed claims
  #
  # Lower values (30-60):
  # - More frequent updates
  # - Shows changes faster
  # - Slightly more CPU usage
  #
  # Higher values (120-300):
  # - Less frequent updates
  # - Better performance
  # - Slight delay showing changes
  #
  # Recommendation: 60 for most servers
  update-interval: 60

  # Custom Region Icons
  # Let players choose icons for their regions on the map
  icons:
    # Enable custom icons feature
    # Players can select from the list below
    enabled: true

    # Default icon (shown when player hasn't chosen one)
    # Must be a direct link to an image file
    default: https://imgur.com/TUQzlCK.png

    # Icon size on map (in pixels)
    # 16-32 is typical, too large can be overwhelming
    size: 20

    # Available Icons
    # Players can choose from these with /region set icon [name]
    #
    # Format: IconName: https://direct-url-to-image.png
