# Sub-Areas

Sub-Areas are specific areas inside a region that have specific flags for players.

## How to Create A Sub-Area

### Selecting Two Points

After getting the selection tool, hold the tool, left-click on the first point, and right-click on the second point.

If you have used the WorldEdit plugin before, it's basically the same as the command `//wand`, where you select two points, but instead of a wooden axe, you use a golden hoe!

!!! warning
    
    You cannot select a point outside a region or select a point that will create a sub-area intersecting another sub-area!

### Applying Changes

After selecting two points, use `/region subareas create [name]`.

## Usage

Sub-Area will allow specific actions from players to do in that area. For example, you can allow one trusted player to open chests in that area, while the rest cannot open them!

You can place rental signs in sub-areas too! [Click here](./Renting%20&%20Selling%20Regions.md) for more information.
