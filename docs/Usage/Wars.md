# Wars

!!! warning

    This is an upcoming feature that is still under development.

A war is an organized armed conflict involving PvP between nations (or regions), characterized by clashes, or territorial disputes, leading to mass killing of players, social disruption, and economic destruction between them.

## Declaring a War

To declare a war, you must confirm that:

- You have an army of players, which are the members of your region.
- Once you get killed by anything during the war, the other nation will be marked as the winner, and you will pay the prize.
- The other nation's members can attack you, but other players and your members will not attack you.
- A member can be a part of your nation and the other nation, so it means they are a regicide, and they can murder you.
- Surrendering first will mark you as the loser, and you will pay the prize.

To declare a war, use: `/hs war declare [region] [prize] (the war name)`

Once the war is declared, these flags will be ignored for the two regions:

- Doors
- Trap doors
- Fence gates
- PvP
- Passthrough

## Surrendering

Once you surrender, the other region will be marked as the winners of the war, which means you must pay the prize.

If you have no choice and you want to end the conflict, use: `/hs war surrender`
