# Experimental

!!! warning

    Experimental features are newly added features that haven't been tested in all examples or must be added but contain some bugs.

    If your server is very active and has a lot of players, we recommend you turn off experimental features.

In **config.yml**, there is a unique key to enable Experimental features:

```yaml
experimental:
  enabled: true
```
