# Ranks and Permissions
## Limits by Groups
Each player has a group; by default, it's `default`. They may upgrade to another rank, for example, `vip` group, so they need special upgrades for their regions, like 6+ more claims, 4+ members... etc.

There are two options for limits:

- **groups**: This will make Homestead use LuckPerms (or any other permissions plugin) to fetch a player's group and then get the group's limit.
- **static**: This will make Homestead not use LuckPerms or any other permissions plugin, but all players will have the same limits (not depending on groups). Note that operators will have different limits.

```yaml
limits:
  # Two valid options:
  # - 'static': Static limits; No permission plugins required.
  # - 'groups': Group limits; Permissions and groups plugin required (LuckPerms...)
  method: 'static'
```

To change the limits, edit the following settings:

!!! warning "Undefined Group"

    If a group is not found, any limit from that group will be **0** by default.

    Please make sure that all groups exist in the **config.yml** file.

```yaml
limits:
  # The limits for player groups.
  groups:
    # Group: default
    default:
      regions: 2
      chunks-per-region: 10
      members-per-region: 4
      subareas-per-region: 2
      max-subarea-volume: 400
      commands-cooldown: 2

    # Group: vip
    vip:
      regions: 4
      chunks-per-region: 20
      members-per-region: 8
      subareas-per-region: 5
      max-subarea-volume: 800
      commands-cooldown: 2

    # Group: admin
    admin:
      regions: 10
      chunks-per-region: 100
      members-per-region: 16
      subareas-per-region: 10
      max-subarea-volume: 1200
      commands-cooldown: 0

  # The limits for operators and non-op players.
  static:
    # Limits for normal players (non operators):
    non-op:
      regions: 2
      chunks-per-region: 10
      members-per-region: 4
      subareas-per-region: 2
      max-subarea-volume: 400
      commands-cooldown: 2

    # Limits for server operators:
    op:
      regions: 10
      chunks-per-region: 100
      members-per-region: 16
      subareas-per-region: 10
      max-subarea-volume: 1200
      commands-cooldown: 0
```

## Limits by Playername

To reduce the complexity of creating many groups for each specific player, you can put their playername in the configuration file to avoid creating multiple groups!

```yaml
player-limits:
  Dead_Master_121: # <-- A player name (he's a cool guy btw)
    regions: 10
    chunks-per-region: 100
    members-per-region: 16
    subareas-per-region: 10
    max-subarea-volume: 1200
    commands-cooldown: 0
    
  TFA_Gaming: # <-- Another player name
    regions: 8
    chunks-per-region: 64
    members-per-region: 8
    subareas-per-region: 5
    max-subarea-volume: 400
    commands-cooldown: 3
```

## Permissions

In the following guide, you will know how to set permissions for a group using the LuckPerms plugin.

1. Use **/lp editor** to generate a link for the web editor of LuckPerms. Once the link is generated, click on it and open it in a web browser.
2. On your left screen, go to "Groups", and then select "default". The "default" group is the group that is automatically given to newly joined players.
3. At the bottom of the page, there is a combobox with a placeholder "Enter permissions", click on it. Select the permissions you want to allow players to use their commands, for example, if you select `homestead.commands.region.create`, this will allow players with the "default" group to use the command **/region create <args>**.
4. Once you select all permissions, click on "+ Add". But before that, if you want to disallow the permissions for the selected group, click on "true" to change it to "false", and then "+ Add".
5. You're good to go! You may need to leave the server and rejoin to update the commands for the client-side.

### Operators
- homestead.admin.forceunclaim
- homestead.commands.homesteadadmin.importdata
- homestead.commands.homesteadadmin.migratedata
- homestead.commands.homesteadadmin.plugin
- homestead.commands.homesteadadmin.reload
- homestead.commands.homesteadadmin.updates
- homestead.operator

!!! danger "Operator Permissions"

    Giving the permission `homestead.operator` or any above it to a group that doesn't have operator role (like moderator or administrator) will cause major risks
    and grief on the server.

    The permission is powerful enough to manage any region and access the administrator commands that are made only for server operators to use Homestead.

    Please, double-check all the permissions you have set before applying changes.
