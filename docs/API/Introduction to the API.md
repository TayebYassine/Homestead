# Introduction to the API

To access the Homestead API in your plugin, download the Homestead **.jar** file from [here](../Installation/Installation.md) and upload it as a third-party JAR to your project.

[Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4955635/how-can-i-add-local-jar-files-to-a-maven-project?page=1) or [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html) for the guide to installing the dependency.

!!! failure "API Updating"

    The API is getting recent updates. Do not use the API until this warning gets removed.

!!! warning

    This section explains the API from version **4.0.2**.
    
    Try to make a condition in your plugin to verify that the installed Homestead version is 4.0.2 or higher. Example version parser and checker:

    ```java
    String version = Homestead.getVersion();

    int versionInteger = Integer.parseInt(version.replace(".", ""));

    if (versionInteger >= 402) {
        // Supported
    }
    ```

## Example Usage

First of all, you must install Homestead plugin on your project by downloading the **.jar** file, moving it on your resources folder, and then load it in your **pom.xml** file (for Maven).

The sample code below will give the instance of Homestead running on the server.

```java
Homestead instance = Homestead.getInstance();
```

This is used to check if Homestead is installed on the server or not; here is another sample code.

```java
try {
    Homestead instance = Homestead.getInstance();

    System.out.println("Homestead plugin was found!");
} catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
    System.err.println("Unable to find Homestead plugin!");
}
```

To get access to the API, use the sample code below:

```java
HomesteadAPI api = new API();
```

Now, your plugin's code should look like this:

```java
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

import tfagaming.projects.minecraft.homestead.*;
import tfagaming.projects.minecraft.homestead.api.*;

public class Plugin extends JavaPlugin {
    public HomesteadAPI api;

	public void onEnable() {
		System.out.println("Plugin has been enabled.");
		
		try {
			Homestead instance = Homestead.getInstance();

			api = new API();

			System.out.println("Homestead plugin was found!");
		} catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
			System.err.println("Unable to find Homestead plugin!");
		}
	}

	public void onDisable() {
		System.out.println("Plugin has been disabled.");
	}
}
```
