# Donating

If you would like to support Homestead by donating money, use crypto.

I ("I", "me" refers to the developer, "T.F.A") only accept cryptos because I'm currently living in a region where PayPal and Stripe are not supported, but I have a virtual card on [ByBit](https://www.bybit.com/).

So, if you would like to donate, please contact me on Discord for the wallet address!
